this is a docker image based on randaz81/r1slam:ros2

it copies some repos from the local folders while others are taken from github.

the repos that are now copied are:
- [yarp-device-realsense2](https://github.com/robotology/yarp-device-realsense2)
- [yarp-ros2](https://github.com/robotology-playground/yarp-ros2)
- [robots-configuration](https://github.com/robotology-playground/yarp-ros2)

It features also the presence of realsense device and can be used with all the devices attached to the pc since the /dev folder mounted is the one from the OS.
