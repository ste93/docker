this is a docker image based on randaz81/r1slam:ros2

it copies some repos from the local folders while others are taken from github.

the repos that are now copied are:
- yarp-device-realsense2
- yarp-ros2
- robots-configuration.

It features also the presence of realsense device and can be used with all the devices attached to the pc since the /dev folder mounted is the one from the OS.
